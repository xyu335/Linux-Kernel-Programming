# Virtual Memory Page Fault Profiler

- Design a lgihtweight tool that can profile page fault rate  
- Learn the kernel-level API like character devices, vmalloc, mmap 
- Test with kernel-level profiler by using a user-level benchmark program by performaing memory allocation/deallocation/local access/ random access operations  
- Analyze, plot and document the profiled data as a function of the workload charateristics
